# Assignment-1

The Project Name is SussyScans
SussyScans is a Scanlation website that provides translated comics varying from Chinese Manhua and Korean Manhwa to English.

#### Thinking points

# ● Is the web site sound and fits the audience intent?

SussyScans is a Scanlation website that provides translated comics varying from Chinese Manhua and Korean Manhwa to English.
The Website itself serves as a catalogue of works that the Scanlation has translated themselves/ got the permission to upload on their website
The Website fits the users' needs as it allows them to browse through to find and read comics that they want to read easily

To summarise,
an online collection of comics that were translated by the scanlation group for others to read and enjoy

# ● Have you tested across browsers?

The website has so far been tested in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

# ● Is the website developed as close to what was proposed in the wireframe and

# documentation?

# ● Is the navigation structure sound?

Although unfinished. There is a perfect walkthrough of what the navigation should be like due to the sheer amount of work needed if the navigation must be
thoroughly completed

##### Real world application

# ● Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum

# placeholder text

# ● All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked

✓

# ● The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the project

✓

# ● Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have

# clearly been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented.

##### Version control systems are used effectively:

# ● all code is managed in git with well-described commit messages

May have not realised about the git function until very late into the assignment, can explain if needed to clarify about code/ where i got the code from

# ● there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fit

# ● there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development

# process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism

##### The full application development process is documented:

Did not realise about git until late into assignment. I do have zip files of the assignment at different stages and screenshots of early-late versions of the website

# ● the purpose of the application is clearly described in the README

✓

# ● the project's documentation describes the design work undertaken for this project

# #and the reasoning behind it

# ● wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process are
