                            <p>"It turns out my time has come."</p>

                            <p>Regis looked up at the almighty presence before him. His body was full of fatal wounds and he couldn't muster up the strength to even stand.</p>

                            <p>He wounded far beyond recognition, it was a miracle that he was even alive, much so even conscious.</p>

                            <p>He had finally managed to confront the Mage Emperor, but was swiftly taken care of just moments after confronting him.</p>

                            <p>The Mage Emperor casted one final spell at Regis, before completely disintegrating his body, not leaving even bones behind.</p>

                            <p>~~~</p>

                            <p>By the hillside was a city, it's wall stretching almost 5 kilometers in each side. It's name being Yolandwar.(yo-len-dwar)</p>

                            <p>Outside of the Yolandwar, the entire world has been plagued by demon beasts which go by the name of Naucht.</p>

                            <p>Although a large majority of humans have perished with the sudden appearance of these beasts, small numbers of human settlements managed to build safe havens, establishing different strongholds from these demons.</p>

                            <p>Yolandwar was one of them.</p>

                            <p>~~~</p>
                            <p>In the Yolandwar College, a batch of 50 new students are sat down in their classrooms and briefed by a female teacher.</p>

                            <p>The Yolandwar College was a prestigious magic school known throughout the city, since birth students have been carefully handpicked by the officials within the college due to their aptitude for magic. Once in every ten births, then comes a child that is able to bring forth the innate power of magic.</p>

                            <p>When testing for magic capabilities, there is no way to ascertain the level of magic to one can use at a young age. Only until they reach the ripe age of 13 only then can they actually release magic.</p>

                            <p>"Hey, haven't you heard? That teacher standing over there is, Michelle Stars, a Gold Rank mage."</p>

                            <p>A few students were discussing amongst themselves.</p>

                            <p>The males, of course being males, stared at the teacher. It was the ripe age of puberty after all, it was normal for boys of their age.</p>

                            <p>The girls, just sat idly by carefully listening to the teacher's speech.</p>

                            <p>She had a relatively tall figure, with a well tied ponytail followed with a tight fitting dark red dress, accentuating her perfect figure. Her eyes violet-purple, a sign that she was most likely and definitely from the Stars Family, which had a distinctive purple eye color trait.</p>

                            <p>"Mages have 3 different classes, the support, combat and spell mages. Each having each own sub-category ranging from Bronze, Silver, Gold , Ruby and lastly Sapphire."</p>

                            <p>"The power that you currently have and the rank bestowed upon you can never change. A mage can never improve and will always stagnate at the same level. Meaning once you get your rank later on, that rank will stick with you forever.", Michelle grinned as she said that.</p>

                            <p>At this point of time, no one knew that raising ranks was actually possible. Only if you have proper knowledge of what to do.</p>

                            <p>Michelle was a Gold Rank Mage, many could only dream to reach the height of a gold rank mage as most would end up as a silver if not bronze.</p>

                            <p>"Wait what?!! Why am I back here? Wasn't I fighting the sage emperor a while ago?" Regis thought to himself.</p>

                            <p>He scanned his own body and realised that his hands had shrunk, heck his entire body had matured backwards. He looked around only to see multiple of his classmates and his teacher, all still alive and well.</p>

                            <p>"Wait this... this was when I first joined he school."</p>

                            <p>Regis clearly remembered what his classroom looked like</p>

                            <p>"But it was destroyed ages ago!"</p>

                            <p>He remembered that a few years after joining the class, the entire city would be invaded by a massive amount of Nauchts, numbering close to a million.</p>

                            <p>It came to his attention that he in fact, travelled back in time. To a past where he was still schooling.</p>

                            <p>He looked around, Elaine Snow, of the snow family, and also his fianc√©, was still alive right before him.</p>

                            <p>He clearly remembered the gruesome scene of a Naucht tearing apart her body as it sunk its teeth into her upper neck. Those scenes, were extremely hard to remember for Regis.</p>

                            <p>However not he did not want the same thing to happen to her again. He sat dazed at his seat, remembering his escape from the city attempting to find a place to hide with her, just when he thought they were safe, a Naucht came out from underground, stabbing her though the guts with its sharp horn and biting through her upper neck. This all happened because Elaine had sensed the approaching Naucht and pushed Regis out of harms way, sacrificing herself to protect him.</p>

                            <p>"Regis Wind, can I ask why you aren't paying attention? You should stop staring at Elaine and start staring at me" the teacher said.</p>

                            <p>Elaine, who sat the the north-west of Regis, turned behind and showed a look of disgust, also showing a slight hint of blush.</p>

                            <p>"Who was this dude staring at me" she thought</p>
                            <p>"He definitely didn't deserve me." Although her thoughts were insincere, her actions did say otherwise for throughout the lesson her mind was thinking about Regis. She couldnt find a reason for why she kept on thinking about him even though they had no connection with each other.</p>

                            <p>Regis's face immediately flushed red and sat attentively and paid attention to every word the teacher said.</p>

                            <p>He thought to himself, "Why am I back here? I should have died by the hands of the Mage Emperor."</p>

                            <p>Dazed again, Regis snapped back to reality as he saw his class slowly exiting the room, with Michelle staring him down like tigress.</p>

                            <p>He got off his sit and hurried down the stairs, following suite the uniform line his class walked in.</p>

                            <p>On the first day of school, students are given an aptitude test to determine their ranking for their level of magic, what type of Mage however is entirely up to them.</p>

                            <p>The test was simple, touch a crystal ball and imbue it with your own magic. The amount of light generated will show the affinity level you have for magic.</p>

                            <p>Regis remembered the dim light he once had, giving him the lowest of ranks, bronze. Which made him a laughing stock. Everyone else in his class got a minimum of silver, with a few exceptions reaching gold and even ruby.</p>

                            <p>"Silver"</p>

                            <p>"Silver"</p>

                            <p>"Silver"</p>

                            <p>"Silver"</p>

                            <p>"Gold"</p>

                            <p>"Silver"</p>

                            <p>It was now Regis's turn. Although he somewhat expected the outcome, he couldn't help but be nervous in the presence of his own class.</p>

                            <p>Slowly, he walked up to the crystal ball and imbued his own magic into it. Giving it a dim glow which wouldn't even be on par with the candlelight which comes from a birthday cake candle. Making everyone laugh at him.</p>

                            <p>But Regis had knowledge from his previous life, decades of experience and knew that there was actually a way to increase one's affinity for magic. Although it was infinitely slow, it was still possible to raise one's rank.</p>

                            <p>So Regis put on a strong front and joined the class in a line.</p>

                            <p>A Bronze Mage was no different than a regular soldier in a battlefield. The magic output of a bronze was so small that it wouldn't even to light a candle on fire, much less do damage to a Naucht.</p>

                            <p>To make up for their lack of power, artifacts are used but they cost a small fortune. Artifacts can come in any shape or size, be it weapons, armour. Any type can be found as an artifacts.</p>

                            <p>Regis was part of the Wind Clan, a small clan which lived at the outskirts of the city that made a living by farming. This, Regis has no means to be able to get any artifacts and only had himself to rely on.</p>

                            <p>A few years after enrolling into Yolandwar College, the city was attacked by a horrifying amount of Naucht. Outnumbered, the city was left to ruins and only a few managed to escape. Despite the many mages within the city walls, many of the stronger mages decided that protecting the city was not worth risking their life, thus they fled and left.</p>

                            <p>Regis who was injured on the battlefield was saved by Elaine. He owed his life to her for without her, he probably wouldn't have lived as long as he did and wouldn't be able to challenge the Mage Emperor.</p>

                            <p>If it wasn't for the destruction of the city, Regis would have probably never gotten the favour of Elaine. After all, he was from a declining family and was only a Bronze rank.</p>

                            <p>It was back to class before the Teachers reminded each students of their ranks, writing them on the chalk board</p>

                            <p>"1 Bronze, 38 Silvers, 11 Gold, 1 Ruby" she said</p>

                            <p>Regis was he only outcast among them, and was thus ashamed. He already experienced this once but this time, he knew how to work things out.</p>

                            <p>With the knowledge from his previous life, he had found many ways of increasing one's own affinity for magic. For example, cultivation and elixirs. Even the act of discharging spells improved one's affinity for magic.</p>

                            <p>The changes were subtle so there really wasn't any change in ranks, so everyone thought that raising one's rank was close to impossible.</p>

                            <p>But if one trained their hardest to raise a rank, spending a lifetime increasing by 2 ranks wasn't as impossible as it seemed.</p>

                            <p>If Regis worked hard, he could make it to Gold.</p>
                            <p>He had he entire world memorise day the back of his head and future events all remembered at the tip of his fingertips. He could definitely make use of this information. Even crafting recipes, treasure locations, he could write them out easily.</p>

                            <p>"Turn to Chapter 3 of the Fire Type Attacks. This is the most commonly used flame spell also known as the Fireball."</p>

                            <p>She turned towards a dummy and pointed her finger towards that direction and chanted.</p>

                            <p>"All Burning Flame, gather within my hands and burn the enemy before me!"</p>

                            <p>A ball of fire appeared at the tip of her finger before she threw it, setting the dummy ablaze. The class wowed her after witnessing the spell.</p>

                            <p>Regis stood up and shouted across the classroom "Ms Michelle, I believe the chant you used is wrong."</p>

                            <p>Upon hearing, Michelle Star was immediately offended, "Are you saying that the chants passed down from our ancestors are wrong?! If so, I implore you show us the actual chant!"</p>

                            <p>He walked down the flight of stairs and started at another similar dummy.</p>

                            <p>"Fire Ball"</p>
                            <p>Almost immediately a fireball appeared and did somewhat the same amount of damage.</p>

                            <p>The reason why his damage was lower was only because his affinity for magic was drastically less than his teacher. If they were on the same level, it would have been child's play to replicate the same spell as his teacher. But Regis had almost used up his entire mana reserves to do a fire ball on par with his teacher.</p>

                            <p>"No Chant?"</p>

                            <p>Although the damage was similar their Teachers, the fact that the spell was chantless in itself was amazing. All chants were time consuming and removing the chants meant being able to save a lot of time.</p>

                            <p>However his teacher, still did not believe him.</p>
                            "That spell was obviously different, not only did it require more mana from him but it also finished his entire mana reserves. There is no way his chant was better."</p>

                            <p>Everyone did not want to offend her, so agreed to her accusation.</p>

                            <p>For some reason, even in his previous life, his teacher always had something against him. And even now, the teacher was showing her true colours to Regis.</p>

                            <p>Her cold smile looked down at Regis as the class gave him scornful looks. The type you give when you look at a failure.</p>

                            <p>Back then, during the invasion of Nauchts. His teacher and their entire clan vanished without a trace, leaving the entire city to fall into ruins. They must've abandoned the city and only cared for themselves.</p>

                            <p>Regis remembered that the teacher did say something about never being to raise a rank so he told her.</p>

                            <p>"I think I can raise my rank"</p>

                            <p> whole class followed suit in laughter</p>
